# Fret Visual

Fret Visual is an interactive, high-fidelity fretboard visualizer for guitar-family instruments, built to support songwriting, riff discovery, and harmonic exploration.

It is designed around how musicians actually think when writing: visually, spatially, and in the context of where you are on the fretboard and within a song.

## Why This Exists

Fret Visual exists to bring together the tools and context needed for writing music on guitar-family instruments into a single, cohesive workspace.

Many existing music theory and fretboard tools are narrowly focused: one for chord identification, another for scale diagrams, another for note reference. They often assume standard tuning, standard strings, or static diagrams that are disconnected from how players actually move around the neck.

Fret Visual combines these ideas into one interactive view:
- the fretboard itself
- the active key and scale
- chord construction and identification
- instrument configuration and tuning

All of this information stays visible and synchronized, so ideas can be explored directly on the neck without switching tools or translating between representations.

The goal is not memorization or theory drills, but **exploration** — making it easy to see what works in a given musical context and discover new voicings, transitions, and riffs. Push beyond familiar patterns and uncover new possibilities across the neck.

## What It Does

- Visualizes fretboards for guitars and basses
- Supports extended-range and non-standard instruments
- Lets you build chords directly on the neck
- Keeps musical context (key, scale, interval function) visible at all times
