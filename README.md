## About

Fret Visual is a song and riff writing companion that displays the guitar fretboard and all notes that are in your key!

It is highly configurable, allowing you to select 6-8 strings, the guitar tuning, and the key you're playing in.

You can also click on a note on the fretboard to open a chord explorer. Chord explorer will treat the first note you clicked as the root note. You can configure the type of chord (eg major/minor), and then notes within a few frets of your selected root note that appear within the chord you've designated will appear on the fretboard. Clicking one of those notes will lock it in (click it again to unlock), allowing you to build out a chord. A chord calculator in the toolbar will live update as you go - so for example, if you configure the explorer to look at C Major notes, but only select the 1 and 5, the calculator will tell you that you have a power chord selected.

You can save chords to the Riff Strip at the bottom of the screen to easily refer to them later. You can also export your session as a json file, and then copy/paste that json through the import screen later to pick up right where you left off!
